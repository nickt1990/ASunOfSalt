y s "When we first met and I told him that I wanted to be an engineer he looked at me straight in the eyes and told me that wasn't gonna happen."

y n "One hundred and thirty two."

y su "That's point zero zero one percent of the 95 thousand people who worked there."

y n "You'd think that would discourage a kid, {w=0.15}but it did the opposite."

y s "I stopped having fun."

y s "I stopped taking chances."

y n "I realized that I had to be the best I could, {w=0.15}and I couldn't afford to dick things up. Every decision became a balancing act."

y n "Does this add or take away from my chances?"

y n "When I looked at guys, {w=0.15}I saw a negative point zero eight percent chance of getting off my shit station and into a real life."

y n "There are plenty of losers to pump out kids."

y s "But why strive for something better when what you have is good enough?"

y s "I'm definitely not happier than the millions of stupid people who wake up every day and piss their lives away."

y s "I worked my ass off and the only benefit that could possibly come from it will be for all those stupid people back home who are already fine."
